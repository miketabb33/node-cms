# CMS NODE
A follow along project from an Udemy classes "content management systems" section. 

Class Details: [Node.js for Beginners - Become a Node js Developer + Project](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-for-beginners-become-a-nodejs-developer/)

The course does not exhibit best practices nor does it include testing. I've challenged myself to write tests and follow best practices during the completion of the project. The aim is to have an apples to apples comparison for the website and its behavior but with the uptmost quality in code.

## Getting Started

1. run `npm install`
2. run `npm start`
3. visit `localhost:3000`

## Tests
